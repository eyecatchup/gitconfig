# SUBJECT should use impertivite tone* and describe, in essence, what you did.
# Keep the whole line below 52 characters if possible, but below 80 in any case.
#
#   * Impertivite tone means that, for example, you should use 'Change', and not
#     'Changed' or 'Changes'. Or use 'Add', and not 'Added' or 'Adds'.

#
#   * FEATURE   - A new feature (also small additions).
#   * TASK      - Any (small) change that is not covered by the other tags.
#   * BUGFIX    - A fix for a bug.
#   * CLEANUP   - May be used for changes that do NOT alter functionality, but 
#                 try to improve code style and readability.
